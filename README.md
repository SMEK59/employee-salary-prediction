* Data preprocessing: cleaning, encoding, scaling

* Model evaluation using RÂ², RMSE, MAE, and cross-validation

* Visualizations including trend analysis, box plots, violin plots, and outlier detection

* Statistical testing like t-tests and correlation heatmaps

* Generates PDF reports of predictions

* User-friendly interface built with Streamlit

* Deployed on Streamlit Cloud

## Models Used

* Linear Regression

* Random Forest Regressor

* XGBoost Regressor

* Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

* K-Fold Cross Validation for robustness


## Tech Stack

* Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

* Streamlit for frontend
